I’ve developed a **Student Lifestyle based Stress Level Prediction Model** using clean data to understand the key factors influencing stress among students. The analysis revealed that most students experience high stress, which is concerning. I explored correlations between **study hours**, **physical activity**, **sleep**, and **extracurriculars**, finding key insights like:

- Sleep duration negatively correlates with stress. Students who get less than 6 hours of sleep are under stress.
- More study hours increase GPA but also stress levels.
- Physical activity has a slight stress-reducing effect, while excessive social hours negatively affect study time.

I used **Multiclass Logistic Regression** for model prediction, achieving an **accuracy of 82%**. The model shows that **study hours** and **sleep** are major determinants of stress levels.

I’ve also proposed a balanced **24-hour schedule** for students in my notebook, optimizing time for **study**, **extracurriculars**, and **sleep**, helping reduce stress.
